1. What did you do this past week?
This week I finished the Collatz project. It was unfortunate that I couldn't turn it in on time -- I couln't do anything with Github half an hour before the deadline because I didn't realize that I was too close to my storage quota on the CS machine. By the time I had fixed the problem, it was too late...
2. What's in your way?

3. What will you do next week?



Tip of the week: 

<script>
  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
  })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

  ga('create', 'UA-73081993-1', 'auto');
  ga('send', 'pageview');

</script>
