This past week was good. Nothing particularly special.

As for blockers, I still do not really have any.

For the next week, it will be all about Darwin! At this point I think my partner and I are about half way done with the project, hopefully we will be able to finish everything soon. We are almost done with the implementation, and we also did a little testing along the way. Other than that, we just need to write the unit tests and check our output against other classmates' output.

I am kind of running out of new things to comment on for this class (haha). The experience I've had so far since the beginning of the class has not really changed much, I still feel the same way about most of the things as mentioned in earlier posts -- the lecture content is still great, and professor Downing is still amazing at explaining important details; I still find the guest speakers not so interesting, and during lectures having to follow files that involve scrolling around is still quite confusing; pair programming is still great, though it takes a while to get used to working with different partners; etc, etc.

There are only five more weeks of classes left, then I will be graduating! This is quite an exciting time for me. I will keep on pushing hard until the end of the semester. 

Tip of the week: quickly reviewing the Google doc and lecture files before each quiz is very helpful.
