title: Week 8 of CS371P

This past week we didn't really learn new concepts. We went over the project specs, had a guest speaker, and didn't have class on Friday. With that being the case, I didn't really do much for this class other than getting a head start on the project with my partner.

As for blockers, the only one I'd say I have right now is that I can only get the projects to work on the CS machine (the set up), meaning that all the work has to be done through SSH'ing, which for me is quite a pain. Working locally is always more convenient -- I can easily use my choice of text editor and so on without having to do everything through the command line. Seems like this is the case for most people in class as well. 

For the next week (which I assume is the one after spring break we're talking about...), I will be finishing up the allocator project and getting myself back into the flow of studying, so that I can finish this last undergrad semester strong!

As I mentioned above, there wasn't much technical materials we learned this week. It's always very helpful that Dr. Downing spends lectures to explain the details of the project, though I personally feel like he could do less hand-holding and leave some of the solutions to our imagination, instead of handing it all to us. As far as the speaker on Wednesday went, he was the best speaker out of the ones we've had so far in my opinion. It was very relatable and less of the techincal stuff that, very honestly, I could care less to follow. I was happy that lecture got cancelled on Friday, but I'm also concerned that it might be hard to write tests during the break without Dr. Downing explaining the new stuff we're working with in the test c++ file. But anyway, I'm for sure going to enjoy this spring break!

Tip of the week: It's OK to reward yourself generously after half a semester of hard work!
