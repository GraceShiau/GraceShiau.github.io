1. What did you do this past week?
  This past week has been nothing but troublesome setup for this class. Both this blog and Collatz had been a mess! But I'm finally done with the hardest parts (I think). From now on, for this blog I just have to create a new entry weekly, which is easy. And for Collatz, having struggled through Github, Travis CI, Sphere, etc, I believe the worst is behind me. 
2. What's in your way?
  I'd personally like the office hours to spread out more during the week...
3. What will you do next week?
  This coming week I will try to finish Collatz as soon as possible.

This week, what jumped out to me the most is how much I hate the quizzes. I've never been a big fan of using testing as a metric to see how well a student is doing in class, because I personally believe it's inaccurate. How well I understand the class materials, how long I study, and how good I am at coding have never been reflected accurately on timed quizzes or tests where we are put under pressure and not allowed to consult resources where, in real life situations, we'd always be able to consult. I suppose there isn't a lot to be done about this, but I'd still like to get this opinion out there. I hope as we move forward in class with actual lecture materials this situation would get better.

Tip of the week: Grades only matter so much at the end (or not at all once you've establish your abilities and experience as a coder in the industry). Work harder, but don't let it affect you negatively.
