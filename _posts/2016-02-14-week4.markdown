1. What did you do this past week? This week I got an early start on project 2 with my partner. I also kept on attending the lectures and everything I could.
2. What's in your way? Lack of motivation to read the reading assignment. There are so many other things to do...
3. What will you do next week? I will try to finish the project fast and definitely keep up with the lecture materials as I have been doing.

Tip of the week: 

<script>
  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
  })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

  ga('create', 'UA-73081993-1', 'auto');
  ga('send', 'pageview');
