This past week was good, nothing special again.

As for blockers, I do not really have any.

For the next week I will be trying to finish Life early with my partner. We haven't done much so far due to scheduling inconveniences, so I really hope we will be able to comeplete the assignment without too much stress!

We are finally passed vector (as our main focus, anyway). Now that we have had a few lectures about something else, I realized that the slight confusion I had during the vector lectures stems from the fact that we were drilling into such details without me having a clear focus in my head. What I mean by this, is that had the lectures been revolved around completing a certain piece of code that requires the use of the knowledge taught in class, it probably would have been a lot easier for me to soak up all the details. I think this is the case anyway, because I feel like we are going over just as much nitty gritty details about inheritance, but having to complete Life which uses the knowledge extensively, makes the lectures so much easier to take in. It is interesting to realize things like this about how I learn, because I think it will be very helpful for me down the road in my career, where I will always be learning!

Tip of the week: I've probably said this before, but cplusplus.com is seriously amazing for getting all the information you need to write c++ code.
