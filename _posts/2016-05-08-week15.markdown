This past week we finally wrapped up the class!

As for blockers... well, if you are talking about blockers to summer, I still have two more tests.

The next week will be about studying for those two tests (with my best attempt to not slack off). 

We just had our last two lectures and the test this past week. I wish I could say that the last lecture ever for this class was amazing, but I just could not stay awake for the life of me (due to my own fault). Nevertheless, I still think this is one of the best classes ever. I've really gained so much out of the lectures this semester. As for the test... well, echoing what many people have said, there really just wasn't enough time. The questions weren't hard, there was just simply too much code to read through to figure out what's going on. I was able to rush to completion most of the questions, but I was unable to check any answers (and you can guess which two I was confused on how to do at all by the fact that I wasn't able to stay awake the last lecture...). But with all that being said, I think that the question content itself was great. It effectively tests your understanding of the concepts. I actually enjoyed doing them!

It won't hurt to say this again: thank you so much Dr. Downing. I appreciate the care and effort you give us. I've truly enjoyed taking your class, and I hope there are more and more professors like yourself in the higher-ed in the future.

Tip of the week: ... HAVE A FANTASTIC SUMMER!!!
