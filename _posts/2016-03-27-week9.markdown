This past week was quite busy for me. Coming back from spring break was a little hard, and other than the allocator project I also had another test. The majority of the week was spent taking care of these things.

As for blockers, I still don't really have any.

For the next week, I will probably just be finishing up the new Darwin project if my partner and I haven't already done so by then.

The class is still going swimmingly well for me. It is indeed getting a little harder to follow the materials in lectures than before, but it's nothing to sweat about as long as I pay a little more attention and review after class. As usual, all the details of C++ we're learning are extremely important, which I know from painful personal experience, i.e. working on projects that needed these concepts which led to long hours of head-scratching, screen-staring, and internal crying. Now that I'm actually learning these concepts solidly, it feels so nice.

The third project went well as well, only with a little difficulty due to the fact that my partner and I were not sure what exactly goes on in the tests. At the end, however, we were able to figure it all out without too much frustration.

Hopefully all of these continue for the next 6 weeks until the end of school!

Tip of the week: Not compeltely techinical, but I think it's nice to keep up with the news in the technology industry by subscribing to various news source. I at least skim the headlines of New York Times, The Washington Post, and Wire everyday (since I have the free email subscriptions).
