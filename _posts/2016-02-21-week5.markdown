1. What did you do this past week? My partner and I finished the Voting project early with time to spare. It was such a great feeling to turn things in early!
2. What's in your way? I feel that most of the road blocks I was struggling with at the beginning of the semester are gone now. :)
3. What will you do next week? I will keep up with the class materials as always, and perhaps start practicing/studying for the midterm!

Pair programming has always been quite interesting to me. I've done it in one other class with only one partner, and I must say that the experience and results vary largely from partner to partner. Overall, I feel like I prefer pair programming when it comes to school assignments since it somehow, for me, takes off some pressure for getting good grades. Perhaps that's due to the fact that two brains solve problems faster and better than just one. I also don't have to worry about working on the assignment when I am not meeting with my partner (per good practice). There are obviously trade offs for these good things, for example the different working styles, scheduling conflicts, difference in experience and knowledge, etc. While there are always ways to resolve the inconveniences, pair programming as a practice is just a very unique experience in so many ways.

For this particular pair programming for the Voting project, I've really enjoyed it. My partner's and my coding styles are fairly similar as well as our skill sets. While we looked at and solved the problem in pretty different ways and we had to do some picking and choosing for implementations, it was very cool to see a different technical perspective other than mine. On top of that, my partner was also a very clean coder, which I've learned to appreciate after I've seen some quite ugly and incomprehensible things from other places. I think the key thing that made this a great experience was that we communicated frequently and clearly, and we respected each other's views and differences, which I believe is very important in everything we do on a daily basis.

In conclusion, I think that pair programming is a great thing for this class! I hope that future projects will work out well as well.

Tip of the week: When resolving errors, check the most obvious things before diving into complicated assumptions. Our gtest for a specific method was seg faulting for a very long time, and we couldn't figure out why. Then we realized that it was the simplest mistake -- we gave the method the wrong input.
