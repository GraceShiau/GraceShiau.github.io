1. What did you do this past week? My partner and I finished the Voting project early with time to spare. It was such a great feeling to turn things in early!
2. What's in your way? I feel that most of the road blocks I was struggling with at the beginning of the semester are gone now. :)
3. What will you do next week? I will keep up with the class materials as always, and perhaps start practicing/studying for the midterm!

Tip of the week:

<script>
  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
  })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

  ga('create', 'UA-73081993-1', 'auto');
  ga('send', 'pageview');
