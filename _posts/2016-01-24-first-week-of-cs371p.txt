1. What did you do this past week?
    We had the first two classes of the semester, and I was able to begin adjusting myself both mentally and technically to what's required of us for this class.
2. What's in your way?
    There is a lot to do even just for the first project. Having barely used Github and not learned it solidly, I think I'll need to do some extra research to catch up. 
3. What will you do next week?
    I will be starting my project early since there is so much to setup! I will also try to consistently review the material we went over in class.

It feels like this will be quite intense of a class. We move at a moderate pace, though letting your mind wander definitely doesn't do you any good. The classroom is quite cramped, which isn't always pleasant, though I suppose there isn't a lot we can do about it. I'm not sure exactly how I feel about Dr. Downing's style of involving students in the lectures (i.e. picking students on by on and putting them on the spot). I think it's something we'll all just get used to eventually. It's probably beneficial because we are contantly kept on our toes, though at this point of the semester it's still a little... scary. Overall, it's been a positive first few lectures! I am very excited about all the (actually) useful knowledge we will be able to bring with us into the real world.

Tip of the week: don't fall behind early on in the semester!
