title: First Week of CS371P 
---
1. What did you do this past week?
    We had the first two classes of the semester, and I was able to begin adjusting myself both mentally and technically to what's required of us for this class.
2. What's in your way?
    There is a lot to do even just for the first project. Having barely used Github and not learned it solidly, I think I'll need to do some extra research to catch up. 
3. What will you do next week?
    I will be starting my project early since there is so much to setup! I will also try to consistently review the material we went over in class.

It feels like this will be quite intense of a class. We move at a moderate pace, though letting your mind wander definitely doesn't do you any good. The classroom is quite cramped, which isn't always pleasant, though I suppose there isn't a lot we can do about it. I'm not sure exactly how I feel about Dr. Downing's style of involving students in the lectures (i.e. picking students on by on and putting them on the spot). I think it's something we'll all just get used to and will be quite beneficial because we are kept on our toes, though at this point of the semester it's still a little... scary. Overall, it's been a positive first few lectures!

Tip of the week: don't fall behind early on in the semester!

Regards,
Grace Shiau

Week of 24 Jan 2016

If you're interested in doing a weekly blog, it must be created with GitHub Pages:

https://pages.github.com

and it must use Jekyll:

https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/
https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now
http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/
http://jekyllrb.com
http://jekyllthemes.org

It must also have Google Analytics:

http://www.google.com/analytics/

with an entry every week of the experience of being in the class.

Make the title (not the URL) of your blog:

CS373 Spring 2016: <your full name>

For example:

CS373 Spring 2016: John Galt

Your blog must also have a good quality head shot (at least 560x640, rendered on the screen to be at least 1.75x2.00 inches) where you are recognizable and look professional (no avatars, no pets, no cartoons!) The head shot must be visible when reading an individual post of your blog.

Your blog must not require a password to read.

Blog entries must be 250 words minimum.

Please click on "Compose a new followup discussion" and paste only the URL of the blog entry.

Once you've posted the URL to Piazza, make sure it works by clicking it.

And please do not click on Resolve. I'll mark it resolved when I read it.

A future employer will be interested in your ability to express yourself well in English, including good spelling and grammar. Take this opportunity to practice that.

Start by answering the following three questions relative to the class:

1. What did you do this past week?

2. What's in your way?

3. What will you do next week?

Then describe your experience in the class. Don't regurgitate the details of the content of the class. I'm interested in your personal reaction to the class as a whole. Imagine someone not in the class reading it and you're trying to give them a sense of what it's like to be in the class. Comment on the lectures, the examples, the exercises, the quizzes, the projects, and the tests.

I'd also like you to include a tip-of-the-week that you've discovered and that you think somewhat relevant to software development, for example, an article, a tool, a service, a website, and maybe even a game.

Please read the weekly blog entries of the other students and comment on them.

To comment on someone else's weekly blog entry, find their followup and click on "Write a reply...".
